## 🛠 Problem Statement & Proposed Solution

### ❗ Problem:

Millions of students, especially in developing regions, face challenges accessing quality educational resources due to:

Although many premium resources exist online, they are:

SkillHive offers a **centralized, beginner-friendly educational platform** that:

- Curates free, high-quality resources  
- Provides PDFs, old academic books, and skill-development courses from **trusted sources**  
- Implements a **points-based reward system** to incentivize learning, resource sharing, and community participation  
- Fosters a healthy competitive environment through **leaderboards**

The platform will be built as a responsive, web-based solution with the following features:

- **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, mobile-friendly UI

  - Completing courses  
  - Downloading resources  
  - Participating in community features  
- **User profiles** with basic progress tracking  
- **Leaderboard** to showcase top learners
